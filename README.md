# Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis
I made use of a parquet file consisting of data pertaining to reviews of food products on Amazon.


I then made use of VADER and RoBERTa from HuggingFace to perform sentiment analysis on the data.


This project is inspired by Rob Mulla.


The dataset is available on Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews
